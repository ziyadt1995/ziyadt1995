- 👋 Hi, I’m Ziad
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, optimization, quantum computing and computational neuroscience. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different ways to increase robustness of machine learning models to advesarial attacks, and ways to attack models to expose their vulnerabilities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on deep learning applications and deep learning research projects.
